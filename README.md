# Bullldozer-price-detection-kaggle-ML

I have built a Machine learning Regression model for determining the bulldozer price.

The data is used from the competition held in 2012 on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

The Library used is Scikit Learn.
The model used is RandomForestRegressor

Evaluation is done on test and valid data set, in terms of root-mean-square-log-error: 0.24
